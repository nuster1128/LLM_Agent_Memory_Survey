# A Survey on the Memory Mechanism of Large Language Model based Agents

![abstract](assets\abstract.png)

Large language model (LLM) based agents have recently attracted much attention from the research and industry communities. Compared with original LLMs, LLM-based agents are featured in their self-evolving capability, which is the basis for solving real-world problems that need long-term and complex agent-environment interactions. The key component of the agent to support its interactions with the environment is the memory. While previous studies have proposed many promising memory mechanisms, they are scattered in different papers, and there lacks a systematical review to summarize and compare these works from a holistic perspective, and thus, failing to abstract common designing rules and extract effective patterns for inspiring future studies. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory mechanism of LLM-based agents. In specific, we first discuss "what is" and "why do we need'' the memory in LLM-based agents. Then, we systematically review previous studies on how to design and evaluate the memory module. At last, we present many agent applications where the memory module plays an important role. To further push the boundary of this direction, we analyze several limitations of existing memory modules and also pose potential solutions.

## ü§ñ Why We Need Memory in LLM-based Agent

### Perspective of Cognitive Psychology

Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of human mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem-solving, creativity, and reasoning. Among these processes, memory is widely recognized as an extremely important one. It is fundamental for humans to learn knowledge by accumulating important information and abstracting high-level, form social norms by remembering cultural values and individual experiences, take reasonable behaviors by imagining the potential positive and negative consequences, and among others. A major goal of LLM-based agents is to replace humans for accomplishing different tasks. To make agents behave like humans, following human working mechanisms to design the agents is a natural and necessary choice. Since memory is important for humans, designing memory modules is also significant for the agents. In addition, cognitive psychology has been studied for a long time.  Many effective human memory theories and architectures have been accumulated, which can well support more advanced agent capabilities. 

### Perspective of Self-Evolution

To accomplish different practical tasks, agents have to self-evolve in dynamic environments. In the agent-environment interaction process, memory is key to the following aspects:
**(1) Experience accumulation.**
An important task of the memory is to remember past error plannings, inappropriate behaviors, or failed experiences, so as to make the agent more effective for handling similar tasks in the future. 
This is extremely important for enhancing the learning efficiency of the agent in the self-evolving process.
**(2) Environment exploration.** 
To self-evolve in the environment, the agents have to explore different actions and learn from the feedback. By remembering historical information, the memory can help to better decide when and how to make explorations, for example, focusing more on previously failed trials or actions with lower exploring frequencies.
**(3) Knowledge Abstraction.**
Another important function of the memory is to summarize and abstract high-level information from raw observations, which is the basis for the agents to be more adaptive and generalizable to unseen environments.

### Perspective of Agent Applications

In many applications, memory is an indispensable component of the agent. For example, in a dialog agent, memory stores information about the historical conversations, which is necessary for the agent to take the next actions. Without memory, the agent does not know the context, and cannot continue the conversation. In a simulation agent, memory is of great importance to make the agent consistently follow the role profiles.  Without memory, the agent may easily step out of the role during the simulation process. Both of the above examples show that memory is not an optional component, but is necessary for the agent to accomplish given tasks. 

In the above three perspectives, the first one reveals that memory builds the cognitive basis of the agent. The second and third ones show that memory is necessary for the agent's evolving principles and applications.
